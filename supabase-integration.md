**Potential Pain Points & Considerations**

Below is a rundown of various files and configurations that might lead to the “No API key found in request” error, along with some common pitfalls to check.

---

### 1) Environment Variables & Project Settings

• **Check NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**  
  – In your code, you’re using these environment variables in both client and server contexts. If they’re missing or not being injected at runtime (e.g., in Vercel, Amplify, or your local .env), Supabase will complain that no API key exists.  
  – Make sure that when you build and run in production, these environment variables are actually present (sometimes they’re set locally but not in your deployment platform).

• **Allowed Domains in Supabase**  
  – In your Supabase project settings, confirm you’ve added the domain (or localhost) from which your Next.js app is calling. If the domain isn’t whitelisted, you might see API key or authorization issues.

---

### 2) Using Multiple Supabase Clients

You have more than one file that creates or exports a Supabase client:  
• “lib/supabase/client.ts” (the snippet below).  
• “lib/supabase.ts” (a simpler createClient usage).  
• “lib/supabase/server.ts” (a server-side setup).

It’s totally valid to have separate clients for different contexts, but it can cause confusion if one instance is missing environment variables or configured differently than another. Double-check that the calls to Supabase in your dashboard or middleware are all using the correct instance and that each file has the necessary environment variables.

For reference, “client.ts”:
```typescript
import { createClient as createSupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

export const createClient = () => {
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  const supabaseKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  // ...
  return createSupabaseClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
    auth: { persistSession: true, autoRefreshToken: true, detectSessionInUrl: true },
    global: { headers: { 'x-application-name': 'zendesk-clone' } }
  })
}

let supabase
export const getSupabaseClient = () => {
  if (!supabase) {
    supabase = createClient()
  }
  return supabase
}
```
If this file is missing a valid URL or key due to environment issues, calls from the dashboard can fail with “No API key found.”

---

### 3) Client-Side Dashboard Calls

In “app/dashboard/page.tsx”:
```typescript
'use client'

import { useAuth } from '@/components/AuthContext'
import { useSupabase } from '@/hooks/useSupabase'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import TicketCreationScreen from '@/components/ticket-creation-screen'

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()
  const supabase = useSupabase()
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading && !user) {
      router.push('/auth')
    }
  }, [user, loading, router])

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (!user) {
    return null
  }

  return <TicketCreationScreen />
}
```
• This file references `useSupabase()`, which presumably returns the singleton client from “lib/supabase/client.ts” or “lib/supabase.ts.” If that internal import chain is broken or referencing a file with missing environment variables, you’d end up with no API key.  
• Also, check that “TicketCreationScreen” is calling Supabase in a consistent way (it looks like it does a `.from('requests').select('*')`). If that’s failing, it might be the cause of your console error.

---

### 4) Middleware Setup

In “middleware.ts”:
```typescript
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  let supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({ request })

  const supabase = createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return request.cookies.getAll()
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => request.cookies.set(name, value))
          supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({ request })
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
            supabaseResponse.cookies.set(name, value, options)
          )
        },
      },
    }
  )

  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  // ...
  return supabaseResponse
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',
  ],
}
```
• The environment variables here (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!` and `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!`) also need to be valid in the server environment. If the SSR environment can’t access them, the server might not attach the correct headers, leading to “No API key found.”  
• Check your deployment logs to confirm that your environment during middleware execution has those variables.

---

### 5) Potential Conflicts with “lib/supabase.ts” or “lib/supabase/server.ts”

• “lib/supabase.ts” does this:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
```
If some parts of your app use this generic version while other parts use “lib/supabase/client.ts,” confirm that all references consistently point to the same environment keys.

• “lib/supabase/server.ts” uses `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr`. This is usually for server-side data fetching. You might want to ensure that you’re using the right import in each scenario (client vs. server). A mismatch can give you blank or missing headers if the logic is expecting a different environment setup.

---

### 6) RLS (Row-Level Security) or Auth Edge Cases

• If you have Row-Level Security enabled with policies requiring an authenticated user, check whether the user is actually signed in at the point of request. If the session fails, Supabase might respond with a cryptic “No API key” or “no apikey” error if the request can’t attach session credentials.  
• Check your “messages” or “requests” queries in “TicketCreationScreen” (and any other component) to confirm you’re not inadvertently making a call before the user is truly signed in.

---

### 7) Summation of Common Pitfalls

1. **Environment variable mismatch** – Not set in production or typed incorrectly (e.g., missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix).  
2. **Multiple Supabase client definitions** – Some code might be pulling from a version that never sees the environment keys.  
3. **Middleware referencing runtime variables** – If the server environment can’t see them, your SSR calls might drop the apikey.  
4. **Allowed Domain** – If you’re calling from a domain not in Supabase’s allowed origins, it can trigger weird 403 or missing key errors.  
5. **RLS or policies** – Could also lead to an unhelpful “no apikey” message if the request is unauthorized.

---

### Key Next Steps

• Verify (via logs or console output) that both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are truly loaded at runtime in every environment (local dev, production, etc.).  
• Confirm that you only have one or two intentional Supabase clients (one for browser calls, one for server) and that you’re not mixing them accidentally.  
• In Supabase dashboard settings, go to “Project Settings → API” and check the “Configuration” tab. Make sure you have your environment variables set correctly and that the domain is allowed.  
• Confirm that your “middleware.ts” usage or any server function is returning the updated response object with cookies and that no extra logic is interfering with how the headers are appended.  

By walking through each of these points, you should pinpoint whether the environment variables are missing, the domain is unlisted, or the client calls are simply referencing the wrong Supabase config.
