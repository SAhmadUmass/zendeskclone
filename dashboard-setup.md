Below is a step-by-step outline that a junior developer can follow to integrate the new layout, ticket creation screen, dashboard page, and updated UI components (avatar, badge, card, textarea, tooltip) into the existing project. These steps do not contain actual code listings or line numbers but will reference specific files and general approach. Feel free to adapt each step to suit your workflow.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Review the Existing Structure
   • Files to examine:  
     – app/layout.tsx (the root layout)  
     – app/auth/page.tsx (authentication flow)  
     – app/dashboard/page.tsx (your new or existing dashboard)  
     – components/ticket-creation-screen.tsx (ticket creation UI)  
     – components/ui/* (avatar, badge, card, textarea, tooltip)  

   • Confirm how these pieces currently connect (or should connect) in your routing:
     – The root layout (app/layout.tsx) provides global context (AuthProvider, etc.).  
     – The /auth route leads to sign-in/sign-up logic.  
     – The /dashboard route is the protected area for logged-in users.  
     – The /tickets route encompasses ticket management (with potential nested routes such as /tickets/[id]/page.tsx).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Set Up the New Dashboard Layout
   • If you want to create a special layout for your dashboard, place a file named layout.tsx inside app/dashboard/ (or confirm the existing app/dashboard/page.tsx references the global layout).  
   • Check any top-level imports in your new layout (e.g., “import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'”). Ensure it references existing components properly.  
   • Make sure the new layout (or the existing page) does not conflict with the root layout. In Next.js, any layout.tsx nested deeper than the root automatically wraps only the routes under that directory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Point the Sign-In Flow to the Dashboard
   • In components/SignIn.tsx, verify that once authentication succeeds, you redirect to “/dashboard” (router.push(“/dashboard”)).  
   • If you prefer to rename or restructure these routes, update the push path accordingly.  
   • Confirm that app/dashboard/page.tsx is indeed the correct route to present once a user is authenticated.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Integrate the Updated Ticket Creation Screen
   • Open components/ticket-creation-screen.tsx and confirm it imports from correct local UI libraries (Button, Input, etc. in your “components/ui” folder).  
   • Verify your state variables (e.g., tickets, newTicketTitle, selectedTicket, etc.) align with how you plan to store/fetch tickets later from Supabase or a local array.  
   • Decide where this screen will appear (e.g., embedded in your dashboard page or a /tickets page). Add something like <TicketCreationScreen /> in the relevant layout or page.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) Make Sure the New UI Components Are Placed in components/ui
   • Files likely include:  
     – avatar.tsx  
     – badge.tsx  
     – card.tsx  
     – textarea.tsx  
     – tooltip.tsx  

   • Drop them into components/ui if they are not already.  
   • Look through each component to ensure “use client” is added if it relies on React hooks or Radix components.  
   • Confirm the import paths are consistent (for example, your code typically imports using “@/components/ui/<component>”).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) Confirm Proper Usage of Avatar, Badge, Card, Textarea, and Tooltip
   • For Avatar:
     – Ensure calls to <Avatar>, <AvatarImage>, and <AvatarFallback> match the new file’s exported names.  
   • For Badge:
     – Check that your code (like <Badge variant="outline">) is consistent with the new badge.tsx.  
   • For Card:
     – <Card>, <CardHeader>, <CardContent>, etc. need to point to the new definitions in card.tsx.  
   • For Textarea:
     – Swap any old references to your new <Textarea> if the import path changed.  
   • For Tooltip:
     – Double-check that “TooltipProvider,” “Tooltip,” “TooltipTrigger,” and “TooltipContent” are imported from the new tooltip.tsx.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) Update Any Additional References
   • Look through the rest of the app to see if older versions of these UI components exist. If so, remove or rename them to avoid confusion.  
   • Make sure all references to, for instance, “@/components/Avatar” (old path) now point to “@/components/ui/avatar” if that’s your convention.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) Confirm Everything Builds Successfully
   • Run a local dev build (npm run dev or yarn dev).  
   • Verify no TypeScript or import errors appear.  
   • Navigate through /auth → /dashboard → /tickets (if implemented) to ensure the flow works.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9) Final Checks
   • If any dynamic data (like tickets) will come from Supabase, start replacing the local mock data with real queries once you have the table set up.  
   • Test any sign-out flows (just to be sure your signIn → signOut routes are correct).  
   • Prepare for the next steps like adding AI functionalities with Cursor or any MVP features you need by tomorrow’s deadline.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary
• In short, you’ll drop the new layout, updated screen, and UI components into their rightful folders, fix any import paths, confirm your sign-in flow points to “/dashboard,” and do a final build/test. Once that’s done, you should have a cohesive dashboard experience and ticket creation system aligned with your existing auth logic.
